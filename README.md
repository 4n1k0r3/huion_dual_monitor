# huion_dual_monitor
huion tablet dual monitor solution in Ubuntu

This script is a lifesaver for Ubuntu users who have problems using their Huion graphics tablet on two monitors. All you need to do is configure a pen button with F4, then every time you press the pen button or the F4 key on the keyboard -> the cursor will automatically switch monitors.
